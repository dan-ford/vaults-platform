   - **Issue:** Finance and Metrics pages referenced removed feature flag, causing ReferenceError during Vercel build prerendering
   - **Impact:** CRITICAL - Deployment failing, pages inaccessible
   - **Fix:** Removed all executiveLayerEnabled variable checks from both pages
   - **Files:** `app/(dashboard)/finance/page.tsx`, `app/(dashboard)/metrics/page.tsx`

2. **Commit 95fdcb1:** Fixed PermissionGuard prop from action to require
   - **Issue:** PermissionGuard component expects `require` prop but pages used `action="edit"`
   - **Impact:** HIGH - "Add Snapshot" and "Add KPI" buttons not rendering, blocking user workflows
   - **Fix:** Changed `action="edit"` to `require="edit"` in both pages
   - **Files:** `app/(dashboard)/finance/page.tsx`, `app/(dashboard)/metrics/page.tsx`

3. **Commit 4bd689b:** Fixed SelectItem empty string value error in KPI form
   - **Issue:** Radix UI Select requires non-empty values; unit selector used `value=""`
   - **Impact:** HIGH - KPI form crashing on open with "SelectItem must have non-empty value" error
   - **Fix:** Changed "None" option to `value="none"` and added logic to convert to null when saving
   - **Files:** `components/metrics/kpi-form.tsx`

**P0 CRITICAL: Cross-Vault Portfolio View Implemented:**

1. **Portfolio Dashboard Transformation** (`app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`)
   - **Issue:** Dashboard showed vault-specific metrics instead of portfolio-level cross-vault analytics
   - **Impact:** CRITICAL - Blocked multi-vault investor/executive use case
   - **Fix:** Complete dashboard overhaul with portfolio aggregation
   - **Features:**
     - Portfolio summary cards (Total Vaults, Healthy, Needs Attention, At Risk)
     - Health-based filtering (all, needs-attention, at-risk, stale updates)

   - Health reasons with actionable insights (overdue tasks, critical risks, stale data)
   - Real-time subscriptions for live updates across all vaults
   - Metrics tracked: risks, tasks, OKRs, financial data, KPIs, requests, activity age

3. **VaultTile Component** (`components/portfolio/vault-tile.tsx`)
   - **Design:** Clean, minimal card layout
   - **Structure:**
     - Logo (12x12, object-contain for proper aspect ratio) with company name underneath
     - Health pill (At Risk/Needs Attention/Healthy) vertically aligned with logo
     - Icon-only metrics grid (4 columns): Critical Risks, Active Tasks, Active OKRs, Days Since Activity
     - Color-coded icons (red, blue, purple, gray) with bold numbers
     - Footer badges for financial data, KPIs, and pending requests
   - **Navigation:** Links to /vault-profile (fixed from incorrect /profile link)

- Increased logo size and improved aspect ratio handling
- Color-coded metric icons for quick visual scanning
- Responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2 tablet, 3 desktop)
- Health-based border colors for immediate status awareness

**Database Types:**
- Database types regenerated via Supabase MCP
- All 8 new executive layer tables included (okrs, kpis, kpi_measurements, financial_snapshots, board_packs, decision_approvals, requests, document_sections)
- Note: Pre-existing TypeScript errors remain (Supabase client typing issue, requires separate fix)

**Status:** Portfolio Dashboard complete and functional. Dashboard now serves as cross-vault command center for investors and executives managing multiple organizations.

### Phase I.2 (Comprehensive Platform Audit) - ✅ COMPLETE (October 19, 2025)

**Audit Scope:** All 10 vault-specific modules + Dashboard + database tables

**Findings Summary:**

**✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL (7/10 modules):**
1. Vault Profile - Org info, OKRs, activity feed with realtime
2. Metrics - KPI tracking with measurements and trends
3. Finance - Financial snapshots (ARR, cash, runway) with month-over-month variance
4. Packs - Immutable board packs with SHA-256 hashing and approval workflow
5. Requests - Investor Q&A with notification workflow
6. Members (route: /contacts) - Team management with RBAC
7. Secrets - Trade secret management with versioning and audit trail

**⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION (3/10 modules):**
8. Reports - Enhanced approval workflow implementation needs testing
9. Documents - Sections + inline Q&A feature needs verification
10. Governance/Decisions - Multi-signature approval workflow needs testing

**❌ CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFIED:**
- **Dashboard (Priority 0):** Currently shows vault-specific metrics (tasks, risks, decisions for ONE vault)
- **Required:** Portfolio-level cross-vault analytics showing ALL vaults user has access to
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - Without portfolio view, platform doesn't fulfill multi-vault promise to investors/executives
- **Recommended Fix:** Transform Dashboard to show grid of vault tiles with health indicators, cross-vault KPIs, staleness alerts

**Next Steps (Prioritized):**
1. **P0 - CRITICAL:** Transform Dashboard to portfolio view (cross-vault analytics) - Est: 2-3 days
2. **P1 - HIGH:** Verify Reports, Documents, Governance enhanced features work - Est: 6 hours
3. **P1 - HIGH:** Verify all 8 new database tables have RLS + realtime enabled - Est: 30 mins

**DO NOT proceed with module enhancements** (charts, exports, forecasting) **until core portfolio functionality is complete.**

### Phase I.6 (Finance Module AI Document Analysis) - ✅ COMPLETE
**Status:** Phase 3 (Agent Integration) ✅ COMPLETE (October 20, 2025)
**Goal:** Enable AI-powered financial document analysis (upload XLS/XLSX/CSV → GPT-4 extracts metrics → review & approve)

#### Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **Database migration** (financial_analyses table):
  - Stores AI analysis results with confidence scores
  - JSONB fields for raw_analysis and extracted_data
  - RLS policies using org_memberships pattern (all CRUD operations)
  - Realtime enabled via supabase_realtime publication
  - Links to financial_snapshots via snapshot_id
- [x] **Python agent services** (3 new services in agent/services/):
  - file_parser.py - Parses XLS/XLSX/CSV files (pandas, openpyxl, xlrd)

  - financial_analyzer.py - Orchestrates end-to-end analysis workflow
- [x] **Python dependencies** added to requirements.txt (pandas, openpyxl, xlrd)
- [x] **FastAPI endpoints** (agent/main.py):
  - POST /analyze-financial-document - Triggers background analysis
  - GET /analysis-status/{analysis_id}/{org_id} - Polls analysis progress
- [x] **Next.js API routes**:
  - POST /api/finance/analyze-document - Validates permissions, triggers Railway
  - GET /api/finance/analysis-status/[id] - Returns analysis status from DB
- [x] **TypeScript types regenerated** (includes financial_analyses table)

#### Phase 2: Frontend UI ✅ COMPLETE (October 20, 2025)
- [x] **UI Components created** (components/finance/):
  - financial-document-upload-dialog.tsx - File upload with validation (XLS/XLSX/CSV, 25-50MB max)
  - analysis-review-card.tsx - Review extracted metrics with confidence scores, approve/reject workflow
  - analysis-list.tsx - Table view of all analyses with status indicators
  - table.tsx - Created missing UI component for analysis list display
- [x] **Finance page integration** (app/(dashboard)/finance/page.tsx):
  - Added FinancialAnalysis type definition
  - State management for analyses, upload dialog, selected analysis
  - loadAnalyses() function with realtime subscription
  - Upload Document button (icon-only with outline variant)
  - Document Analysis section with AnalysisReviewCard and AnalysisList
  - Auto-refresh pattern (mount + visibilitychange + realtime)
- [x] **Dependencies installed**:
