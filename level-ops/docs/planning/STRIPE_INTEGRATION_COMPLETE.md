---

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema
**Table: `subscriptions`**
- Location: Applied via Supabase migration `create_subscriptions_table`
- Fields: `org_id`, `stripe_customer_id`, `stripe_subscription_id`, `status`, `plan_tier`, billing period dates
- RLS Policies: Only OWNER/ADMIN can manage subscriptions

   ```

### Step 5: Enable Customer Portal (5 minutes)
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/billing/portal
2. Enable Customer Portal
3. Configure features:
   - Allow customers to update payment methods

### Step 6: Test Subscription Flow (20 minutes)
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `/pricing`
4. Click "Start Free Trial" on Small plan
5. Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`, any future expiry, any CVC
6. Complete checkout
7. Verify subscription appears in `/settings/billing`
8. Test "Manage Billing" button (opens Customer Portal)
9. Test cancellation and reactivation

### Step 7: Production Deployment

## Testing with Stripe CLI (Local Development)

To test webhooks locally without deploying:

### Install Stripe CLI
```bash
# macOS
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Windows
scoop bucket add stripe https://github.com/stripe/scoop-stripe-cli.git
scoop install stripe

# Linux
wget https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/download/v1.19.4/stripe_1.19.4_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xvf stripe_1.19.4_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
sudo mv stripe /usr/local/bin
```

### Forward Webhooks to Local Server
```bash
stripe login
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhooks
```

This will output a webhook signing secret starting with `whsec_...`. Use this for `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local`.

### Trigger Test Events
```bash
# Test successful checkout
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed

# Test subscription update
stripe trigger customer.subscription.updated

# Test cancellation
stripe trigger customer.subscription.deleted
```

## Stripe Test Cards

Use these test cards for development:

| Card Number | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 4242 4242 4242 4242 | Successful payment |
| 4000 0000 0000 0002 | Card declined |
| 4000 0000 0000 9995 | Insufficient funds |
| 4000 0025 0000 3155 | Requires authentication (3D Secure) |

**Expiry:** Any future date (e.g., 12/34)
**CVC:** Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
**ZIP:** Any 5 digits (e.g., 12345)

## Architecture Notes

### Plan Tier Mapping
The system uses lowercase plan tiers internally:
- `free` - Free tier (no Stripe subscription)
- `small` - $49/mo
- `medium` - $149/mo
- `enterprise` - Custom pricing

The `organizations.plan_tier` field uses title case (`Small`, `Medium`, `Enterprise`) for backward compatibility with existing data.

### Subscription Flow
1. User visits `/pricing`
2. Clicks plan CTA
3. System creates Stripe Checkout session via `/api/stripe/checkout`
4. User redirects to Stripe-hosted checkout page
5. User enters payment details and completes purchase
6. Stripe sends `checkout.session.completed` webhook to `/api/stripe/webhooks`
7. Webhook handler updates `subscriptions` table and `organizations.plan_tier`
8. User redirects back to `/dashboard?subscription=success`

### Cancellation Flow
1. User visits `/settings/billing`
2. Clicks "Manage Billing"
3. System creates Customer Portal session via `/api/stripe/portal`
4. User redirects to Stripe-hosted portal
5. User clicks "Cancel subscription"
6. Stripe sends `customer.subscription.deleted` webhook
7. Webhook handler updates subscription status to `canceled` and downgrades org to `Small` (free) tier
8. User redirects back to `/settings/billing`

### Security
- All API routes verify user authentication via Supabase Auth
- Subscription management routes check for OWNER/ADMIN role
- Webhook handler verifies Stripe signature to prevent tampering
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their own org's subscriptions

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. No Trial Period Implementation
The pricing page mentions "14-day free trial" but Stripe Checkout doesn't have trial configured. To add:
1. Edit each Price in Stripe Dashboard
2. Add trial period: 14 days
3. Or use `trial_period_days: 14` in Checkout session creation

### 2. No Proration Logic
Plan upgrades/downgrades don't have custom proration. Stripe's default proration is used. To customize:
- Edit Checkout session with `proration_behavior` parameter
- Handle mid-cycle upgrades/downgrades via webhook

### 3. No Metered Billing
Current implementation is fixed monthly pricing. For usage-based billing:
- Create Stripe metered prices
- Report usage via Stripe API
- Display usage in billing page

### 4. No Tax Collection
Tax/VAT is not configured. For compliance:
- Enable Stripe Tax in Dashboard
- Add tax calculation to Checkout sessions
- Display tax-inclusive pricing if required by jurisdiction

### 5. No Seat-Based Pricing
Pricing is fixed per tier, not per seat. To implement:
- Create quantity-based Stripe prices
- Pass `quantity: org.members_count` to Checkout
- Update subscription quantity via API when members change

---

## Cost Estimate

### Stripe Fees (US)
- **Online payments**: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- **Subscriptions**: Same as above, charged monthly
- **Customer Portal**: Free
- **Webhooks**: Free
- **Radar (fraud detection)**: Included for free

### Example Revenue Calculation
If you have:
- 10 Small plan customers ($49/mo each) = $490/mo revenue
- 5 Medium plan customers ($149/mo each) = $745/mo revenue
- Total monthly revenue: $1,235

**Stripe fees:**
- Small plan fee: $49 × 2.9% + $0.30 = $1.72 per customer × 10 = $17.20
- Medium plan fee: $149 × 2.9% + $0.30 = $4.62 per customer × 5 = $23.10
- Total monthly Stripe fees: $40.30
- **Net revenue: $1,194.70** (96.7% of gross)
