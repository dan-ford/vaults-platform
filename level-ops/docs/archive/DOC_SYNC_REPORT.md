# Documentation Synchronization Report

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Type:** Repository-wide documentation alignment (no code changes)
**Status:** Complete ✅

---

## Executive Summary

All Level repository documentation has been synchronized to reflect the latest **premium "private jet" strategy**, **RLS-first security model**, and **multi-org architecture**. This was a documentation-only pass—zero code or schema changes introduced.

**Key Achievement:** Repository now tells one consistent story from strategy → architecture → implementation → operations → GTM.

## Key Findings

### ✅ What Was Already Well-Aligned

1. **Premium Positioning Clear**
   - "Private jet" language consistent across all strategy docs
   - Founder/C-suite and investor ICPs well-defined
   - Anti-ICPs explicitly called out (no generic task management)

2. **RLS-First Security Model**
   - Deny-by-default policies documented
   - Multi-org tenant isolation patterns clear
   - SECURITY INVOKER functions emphasized

3. **Multi-Org Architecture**
   - User → profiles → org_memberships → organizations pattern established
   - Invitation flow with RPC defined
   - Last-OWNER guard rail documented

4. **RAG Implementation**
   - Hybrid search (vector + BM25) with MMR and neighbor windows
   - Citations and audit trail included
   - Deduplication by content hash

### ⚠️ What Was Incomplete (Now Fixed)

1. **Missing Runbooks**
   - ✅ Created: `onboarding_pilot.md` (4-week pilot success criteria, weekly cadence)
   - ✅ Created: `dedicated_node.md` (region residency, SLA, provisioning steps)

2. **Missing GTM Materials**
   - ✅ Created: `positioning_and_pricing.md` (tiers, ROI calculator, objection handling)

3. **Missing AI Development Guidance**
   - ✅ Created: `claude_operating_instructions.md` (safe migrations, RLS patterns, feature flags)

4. **Missing Consolidated Security Doc**
   - ✅ Created: `security_and_trust.md` (RLS, immutability, region residency, DPA, compliance)

5. **README Navigation**
   - ✅ Updated: Organized doc index with sections (Product, Implementation, Security, Runbooks, GTM, Development)

### ❌ No Breaking or Conflicting Content Found

- Root `CLAUDE.md` properly deprecated (points to `level-ops/CLAUDE.md`)
- All docs use consistent terminology (org vs tenant, OWNER/ADMIN/EDITOR/VIEWER roles)
- No schema conflicts (Data Model aligns with Permissions doc)

## Next Steps (Post-Merge)

This is a **docs-only PR**—no code or schema changes. After merge:

### Immediate (Sprint 3)
1. **Socialize new docs:**
   - [ ] Share Security & Trust Pack with enterprise prospects (via sales team)
   - [ ] Add Pilot Onboarding to CSM Notion workspace
   - [ ] Link Dedicated Node runbook in support KB

2. **Validate docs in practice:**
   - [ ] Run 1 pilot using Onboarding Runbook → refine based on CSM feedback
   - [ ] Provision 1 Dedicated Node using Runbook → update based on Ops feedback
   - [ ] Sales uses Positioning doc in 5+ calls → collect objection data

### Near-Term (30-60 days)
3. **Follow-up PRs** (small, sequential):
   - [ ] Add RLS policy tests to CI (leakage tests from Security doc)
   - [ ] Implement agent write-audit instrumentation (from Claude Operating Instructions)
   - [ ] Create API_REFERENCE.md (OpenAPI/Swagger for FastAPI endpoints)

4. **Quarterly review:**
   - [ ] Update pricing if market/cost changes (align with finance on 70% margin)
   - [ ] Update compliance status in Security doc (SOC 2 progress, pen test results)
   - [ ] Refresh ROI calculator with actual customer data
