# VAULTS Executive Layer - Revised Module Plan

**Updated:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** üü° DEPLOYED - ACTIVATION PENDING
**Critical Note:** All code deployed to production but feature flag `executive_layer_v2` must be enabled per organization to make modules accessible.

---

## Implementation Summary

**Deployment Date:** October 18, 2025 (Commit: 8f364f1)
**Code Status:** COMPLETE - All phases implemented and deployed
**Feature Status:** INACTIVE - Requires feature flag activation
**Total Duration:** Phase 1A-1D + Phase 2 (all completed same day)
**Modules Delivered:** 10 vault-specific + 1 cross-vault
**Database Tables Created:** 8 new tables (okrs, kpis, kpi_measurements, financial_snapshots, board_packs, decision_approvals, requests, document_sections)
**Navigation Structure:** Simplified from 12 to 10 vault-specific modules + top nav for cross-vault features

### üö® IMPORTANT: POST-DEPLOYMENT ACTIVATION REQUIRED

**Current State:**
- All code deployed to production ‚úÖ
- All database tables created with RLS ‚úÖ
- All 7 new modules fully functional ‚úÖ
- **BUT: Feature flag disabled by default** ‚ùå

**To activate for an organization:**
```sql
-- Enable executive layer v2 for a specific organization
UPDATE organizations
SET settings = jsonb_set(
  COALESCE(settings, '{}'::jsonb),
  '{modules,executive_layer_v2}',
  'true'
)
WHERE id = '<organization_id>';

-- Verify it was set correctly
SELECT name, settings->'modules'->'executive_layer_v2' as executive_layer_enabled
FROM organizations
WHERE id = '<organization_id>';
```

**Before enabling, complete these critical fixes:**
1. ‚ùå **TypeScript build is broken** - 22 errors in contacts.tsx and decisions.tsx
2. ‚ùå **Database types outdated** - Missing decision_approvals and document_sections tables
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **No smoke testing performed** - Should test all modules before user access

**Fix sequence:**
1. Regenerate types: `npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id lkjzxsvytsmnvuorqfdl > lib/supabase/database.types.ts`
2. Verify build: `npm run typecheck && npm run build` (must pass)
3. Smoke test all 7 modules (see checklist below)
4. Enable flag for test organization
5. User acceptance testing

### Key Achievements

‚úÖ Multi-signature decision approval system
‚úÖ Document sections with inline Q&A
‚úÖ Investor request/response workflow with notifications

## Key Decisions

### Navigation Architecture
- **Top Nav = Cross-Vault/Global**: Dashboard (portfolio view), org switcher, search, notifications, settings
- **Left Nav = Vault-Specific**: All modules relate to the currently selected vault
- **Profile as Vault Home**: Landing page when selecting a vault, shows org identity + OKRs + recent activity
- **Mental Model**: Top navigation for switching context, left navigation for working within a vault
- **Executive Use Case**: Investors and executives managing multiple vaults need clear portfolio overview
- **Future-Proof**: Sets architecture for portfolio layer with cross-vault analytics

### Module Naming
- ‚úÖ "Profile" (not Org Profile, Vault Profile, or Plan)
- ‚úÖ "Metrics" (not KPIs)
- ‚úÖ "Finance" (not Financials or Financial Snapshots)
- ‚úÖ "Reports" (not Summary or Executive Summaries)
- ‚úÖ "Members" (not Contacts or Team)
- ‚úÖ "Packs" (not Board Packs)
- ‚úÖ "Requests" (not Q&A or Investor Requests)
- ‚úÖ "Governance" (not Decisions and Risks - combined module)

### Modules Removed
- ‚ùå Q&A (not included in scope)
- ‚ùå Tasks (archived, replaced by Requests)
- ‚ùå Milestones (archived, replaced by Plan/OKRs)

### Backward Compatibility
- Feature flag controls visibility (`executive_layer_v2`)
- Existing data preserved (Tasks, Milestones, Contacts tables remain)
- Route aliases TBD for smooth migration
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Final Notes

**Implementation Completed:** October 18, 2025 (Code Complete)
**Activation Status:** PENDING - Requires feature flag enablement and critical bug fixes
**Next Steps:**
1. Fix TypeScript build errors (regenerate database types)
2. Complete smoke testing checklist above
3. Enable feature flag for test organization
4. User acceptance testing
5. Phased rollout to all organizations

**Documentation:** All new features documented in this file and README.md
