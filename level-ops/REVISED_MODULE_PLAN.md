## Key Decisions

### Navigation Architecture
- **Top Nav = Cross-Vault/Global**: Dashboard (portfolio view), org switcher, search, notifications, settings
- **Left Nav = Vault-Specific**: All modules relate to the currently selected vault
- **Profile as Vault Home**: Landing page when selecting a vault, shows org identity + OKRs + recent activity
- **Mental Model**: Top navigation for switching context, left navigation for working within a vault
- **Executive Use Case**: Investors and executives managing multiple vaults need clear portfolio overview
- **Future-Proof**: Sets architecture for portfolio layer with cross-vault analytics

### Module Naming
- ‚úÖ "Profile" (not Org Profile, Vault Profile, or Plan)
- ‚úÖ "Metrics" (not KPIs)
- ‚úÖ "Finance" (not Financials or Financial Snapshots)
- ‚úÖ "Reports" (not Summary or Executive Summaries)
- ‚úÖ "Members" (not Contacts or Team)
- ‚úÖ "Packs" (not Board Packs)
- ‚úÖ "Requests" (not Q&A or Investor Requests)
- ‚úÖ "Governance" (not Decisions and Risks - combined module)

### Modules Removed
- ‚ùå Q&A (not included in scope)
- ‚ùå Tasks (archived, replaced by Requests)
- ‚ùå Milestones (archived, replaced by Plan/OKRs)

### Backward Compatibility
- Feature flag controls visibility (`executive_layer_v2`)
- Existing data preserved (Tasks, Milestones, Contacts tables remain)
- Route aliases TBD for smooth migration
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
