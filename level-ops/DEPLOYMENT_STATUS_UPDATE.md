# Deployment Status Update

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Update Type:** Production Deployment Completion
**Status:** ✅ SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED

---

## Executive Summary

The VAULTS platform has been successfully deployed to production. All deployment blockers have been resolved, and the application is now running on Railway (RAG agent backend) and Vercel (Next.js frontend).

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup ✅
- **Action**: Created clean repository structure
- **Old State**: Duplicate repository with conflicting structure, exposed API keys
- **New State**: Clean `dan-ford/vaults-platform` repository
- **URL**: https://github.com/dan-ford/vaults-platform
- **Key Fixes**:
  - Deleted old repository with root-level conflicts
  - Created new repository with only `level-ops/` subdirectory
  - Removed real OpenAI API key from `.env.production.example`
  - Pushed all code to GitHub main branch

### 2. Railway Deployment (RAG Agent Backend) ✅
- **Action**: Deployed Python FastAPI service to Railway
- **Service Name**: `vaults-agent`
- **Production URL**: https://vaults-agent-production.up.railway.app
- **Status**: Deployed and healthy
- **Key Fixes**:
  - Fixed Python import errors (changed from `agent.config` to `config`)
  - Configured all environment variables (Supabase, OpenAI)
  - Verified document ingestion endpoint is active
  - Confirmed vector search functionality is operational

### 3. Vercel Deployment (Next.js Frontend) ✅
- **Action**: Deployed Next.js application to Vercel
- **Status**: Deployed and operational
- **Key Fixes**:
  - Deleted old misconfigured Vercel project
  - Created new project with correct GitHub connection
  - Set Root Directory to `level-ops`
  - Configured all 7 required environment variables
  - Verified successful build and deployment

### 4. Environment Variables ✅
All environment variables have been configured in both Railway and Vercel:

**Configured Variables:**
- ✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- ✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- ✅ SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
- ✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_COPILOT_CLOUD_API_KEY
- ✅ OPENAI_API_KEY
- ✅ FASTAPI_URL (points to Railway: https://vaults-agent-production.up.railway.app)
- ✅ NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL (Vercel production URL)

## Deployment Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Duplicate Repository Structure
- **Problem**: Root-level configuration files conflicting with subdirectory build
- **Solution**: Created clean repository with only `level-ops/` subdirectory
- **Result**: Vercel 404 errors resolved

### Issue 2: Railway Import Errors
- **Problem**: Python agent failing with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'agent.config'`
- **Solution**: Changed imports from `agent.config` to `config`
- **Result**: Railway deployment successful

### Issue 3: Exposed API Keys
- **Problem**: Real OpenAI API key in `.env.production.example`
- **Solution**: Removed real key, replaced with placeholder
- **Result**: GitHub push protection satisfied

### Issue 4: Vercel Build Configuration
- **Problem**: Vercel building from wrong directory
- **Solution**: Set Root Directory to `level-ops` in Vercel project settings
- **Result**: Build successful
